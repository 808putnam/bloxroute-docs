# grpc.py

The `grpc.py` file defines a `GrpcProvider` class and several functions for creating instances of this class. The `GrpcProvider` class is used to interact with a gRPC service.

The `grpc`, `grpc_testnet`, `grpc_devnet`, and `grpc_local` functions are used to create instances of the `GrpcProvider` class for different environments (mainnet, testnet, devnet, and local, respectively). Each function takes an optional authorization header and returns a `GrpcProvider` instance.

The `GrpcProvider` class inherits from the `Provider` class and overrides several of its methods. It also defines several additional attributes and methods:

* `channel`: This is an optional `grpclib.client.Channel` object that represents a connection to a gRPC server.
* `_host`, `_port`, `_auth_header`, `_use_ssl`, `_private_key`: These are private attributes that store the host and port of the gRPC server, the authorization header for requests, whether to use SSL for the connection, and the private key for signing transactions, respectively.
* `__init__`: This is the constructor of the class. It initializes the private attributes and calls the constructor of the parent class.
* `connect`: This asynchronous method establishes a connection to the gRPC server.
* `private_key`: This method returns the private key.
* `close`: This asynchronous method closes the connection to the gRPC server.

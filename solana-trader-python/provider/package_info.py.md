# package\_info.py

The `package_info.py` file is used to fetch and store information about the `bxsolana-trader` package installed in the current Python environment. The main purpose of this file is to provide a way to access the name and version of the `bxsolana-trader` package from other parts of the application.

Here's a brief overview of what each line does:

1. `import pkg_resources`: This imports the `pkg_resources` module, which is a part of `setuptools`. It's used for querying information about Python packages installed in the environment.
2. `dist = pkg_resources.get_distribution("bxsolana-trader")`: This line fetches the distribution information for the `bxsolana-trader` package.
3. `NAME = dist.project_name`: This line stores the name of the project (in this case, `bxsolana-trader`) in the `NAME` variable.
4. `VERSION = dist.version`: This line stores the version number of the `bxsolana-trader` package in the `VERSION` variable.

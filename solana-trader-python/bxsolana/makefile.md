# Makefile

This `Makefile` provides a convenient way to build the project, clean up generated files, release the package to PyPI, run linting and static analysis, run tests, and set up the integration environment.

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

* `.PHONY: all clean pkg release proto lint fmt fmt-check analyze typecheck test environment-integration`: This line declares all the targets as phony targets. Phony targets are always out-of-date, so `make` always executes their recipes.
* `all: clean pkg`: The `all` target is the default target. When you run `make` without specifying a target, it executes the `all` target. This target depends on the `clean` and `pkg` targets, so `make` executes those first.
* `clean:`: This target removes the `dist`, `build` directories and any `*.egg-info` files.
* `pkg:`: This target builds the Python package using the `build` module.
* `release: all`: This target depends on the `all` target and uploads the distribution files in the `dist` directory to PyPI using `twine`.
* `lint: typecheck analyze fmt-check`: This target runs type checking, static analysis, and format checking.
* `fmt:`: This target formats the code in the `bxsolana` and `example` directories using `black`.
* `fmt-check:`: This target checks if the code in the `bxsolana` and `example` directories is formatted correctly.
* `analyze:`: This target runs static analysis on the code in the `bxsolana` directory using `flake8`.
* `typecheck:`: This target runs type checking on the code using `pyre`.
* `test:`: This target runs unit tests in the `test/unit` directory.
* `environment-integration:`: This target copies a file from an AWS S3 bucket to the current directory.

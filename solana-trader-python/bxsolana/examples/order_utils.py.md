# order\_utils.py

The `order_utils.py` file contains several asynchronous functions that interact with the trading API to place, cancel, and settle orders. They all print messages to indicate the progress of the operations.

Here's a brief overview of each function:

1. `place_order`: This function places an order on the trading platform. It generates a random client order ID, creates a `PostOrderRequest`, signs the transaction, and submits it. It then prints a message with the client order ID and the response signature.
2. `place_order_with_tip`: This function is similar to `place_order`, but it also includes a tip in the `PostOrderRequest`. This could be used to prioritize the order in the trading system.
3. `cancel_order`: This function cancels an order. It creates a `PostCancelByClientOrderIdRequest`, signs the transaction, and submits it. It then prints a message with the client order ID and the response signature.
4. `settle_funds`: This function settles the funds associated with an order. It creates a `PostSettleRequest`, signs the transaction, and submits it. It then prints a message with the response signature.
5. `cancel_all_orders`: This function places two orders, waits for them to be opened, and then cancels all orders. It checks that the orders are cancelled correctly and prints messages at each step.
6. `cancel_all`: This function cancels all orders. It creates a `PostCancelAllRequest` for each open order, signs the transactions, and submits them. It then prints a message with the response signatures.
7. `replace_order_by_client_order_id`: This function replaces an order. It creates a `PostOrderRequest` with the same client order ID as an existing order, signs the transaction, and submits it. It then prints a message with the client order ID and the response signature.

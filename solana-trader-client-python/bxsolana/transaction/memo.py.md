# memo.py

The `memo.py` file is a Python module that provides functions for handling transaction memos in a blockchain-related context.&#x20;

The `TraderAPIMemoProgram` variable is a public key that's associated with the Trader API program. The `BxMemoMarkerMsg` is a string that's used as a default message in the memo instructions.

Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

* `create_trader_api_memo_instruction(msg: str) -> inst.Instruction`: This function generates a transaction instruction that places a memo in the transaction log. If no message is provided, it uses the default `BxMemoMarkerMsg` ("Powered by bloXroute Trader Api"). The function returns an `Instruction` object, which represents a transaction instruction in the blockchain context.

```python
# create_trader_api_memo_instruction generates a transaction instruction that places a memo in the transaction log
# Having a memo instruction with signals Trader-API usage is required
```

* `create_compiled_memo_instruction(program_id_index: int) -> inst.CompiledInstruction`: This function creates a compiled instruction with the `BxMemoMarkerMsg` as the data. The function takes an index of a program ID as an argument and returns a `CompiledInstruction` object.
* `add_memo(tx: solders_tx.VersionedTransaction) -> solders_tx.VersionedTransaction`: This function adds a memo to a given transaction. It modifies the transaction's instructions and account keys to include the memo, then returns the modified transaction.
* `add_memo_to_serialized_txn(tx_base64: str) -> str`: This function adds a memo to a serialized transaction. It decodes the transaction from base64, adds the memo, then re-encodes the modified transaction back to base64.

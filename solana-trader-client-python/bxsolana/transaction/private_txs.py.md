# private\_txs.py

The `private_txs.py` file is a Python module that provides functions for creating tip transactions and instructions for the bloxRoute API in a blockchain-related context.&#x20;

The `BloxrouteTipWallet` variable is a public key that's associated with the bloxRoute tip wallet. This is the destination for the tip transfers.

```python
# as of 2/12/2024, this is the bloxRoute tip wallet... check docs to see latest up to date tip wallet:
# https://docs.bloxroute.com/solana/trader-api-v2/front-running-protection-and-transaction-bundle
```

Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

* `create_trader_api_tip_instruction(tip_amount: uint64, sender_address: Pubkey) -> inst.Instruction`: This function generates a transaction instruction that transfers a tip from the sender to the bloxRoute tip wallet. The function takes the tip amount and the sender's public key as arguments and returns an `Instruction` object.

```python
# create_trader_api_tip_instruction creates a tip instruction to send to bloxRoute. This is used if a user wants to send
# bundles or wants front running protection. If using bloXroute API, this instruction must be included in the last
# transaction sent to the API
```

* `create_trader_api_tip_tx_signed(tip_amount: uint64, sender_address: Keypair, blockhash: Hash) -> solders_tx.Transaction`: This function creates a signed transaction that includes the tip transfer instruction. The function takes the tip amount, the sender's keypair, and a blockhash as arguments and returns a `Transaction` object.

```python
# create_trader_api_tip_instruction creates a tip transaction to send to bloxRoute. This is used if a user wants to send
# bundles or wants front running protection. If using bloXroute API, this transaction must be the last transaction sent
# to the api
```

# Dockerfile-go

The `Dockerfile-go` is a Dockerfile that defines a Docker image with a Go development environment, specifically set up for working with Protocol Buffers and gRPC. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

* `FROM golang:1.17`: This line sets the base image for the Docker image to `golang:1.17`, which is an official Docker image that includes Go version 1.17.
* `ENV PROTOC_VERSION=3.19.3`: This line sets an environment variable `PROTOC_VERSION` to `3.19.3`. This variable is used later to download a specific version of `protoc`, the Protocol Buffers compiler.
* `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install unzip`: This line updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations, and installs the `unzip` utility, which is needed to extract the `protoc` compiler.
* The next `RUN` command downloads the `protoc` compiler from the official GitHub repository, unzips it, and removes the zip file.
* The following `RUN` command installs several Go packages using the `go install` command. These packages are plugins for `protoc` that generate Go code for Protocol Buffers and gRPC (`protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc`), as well as for the gRPC-Gateway (`protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` and `protoc-gen-openapiv2`), which is a tool for exposing gRPC services over HTTP.
* The next two `RUN` commands create directories `/go/protobuf/out` and `/go/protobuf/in` inside the Docker image. These could be used to store input and output files for `protoc`.
* `WORKDIR "/go/protobuf/in"`: This line sets the working directory inside the Docker container to `/go/protobuf/in`. This means that when you run a command in the Docker container, it will be executed in this directory.

In summary, this Dockerfile sets up a Docker image with a Go development environment, equipped with the necessary tools and packages for working with Protocol Buffers and gRPC.

# pyproject.toml

The `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file for Python projects, introduced in PEP 518. It's used to store metadata about the project and to configure various tools. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

* `[project]`: This section contains metadata about the project. `name` is the name of the project, `version` is the current version of the project, `description` is a short description of the project, and `dependencies` is a list of packages that the project depends on. In this case, the project depends on `betterproto` version `v2.0.0b6`.
* `[build-system]`: This section specifies the build system for the project. `requires` is a list of packages that are required to build the project, and `build-backend` is the name of the Python module that will be used to build the project. In this case, the project uses `setuptools` to build.
* `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`: This section configures how `setuptools` finds packages in the project. `where` is a list of directories to search for packages, and `namespaces` specifies whether namespace packages should be used.
* `[tool.black]`: This section configures the `black` code formatter. `line-length` specifies the maximum line length, and `preview` specifies whether to use preview features.

In summary, this `pyproject.toml` file is used to store metadata about the project, to specify its dependencies, to configure the build system, and to configure the `black` code formatter.

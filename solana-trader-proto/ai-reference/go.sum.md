# go.sum

The `go.sum` file is automatically generated by Go for modules. It's used to ensure that future installations of the project retrieve the exact same dependencies as the ones used in the current build, providing reproducibility and integrity.

The file contains cryptographic hashes of the exact versions of dependencies used in the project. When you run `go mod download`, `go build`, `go test`, and other commands, the `go` command checks the `go.sum` file to ensure that the downloaded modules haven't been tampered with since the `go.sum` file was generated.

Each line in the `go.sum` file has the following format:

* `<module>` is the module path.
* `<version>` is the module version.
* `<hash>` is a cryptographic hash of the module at the specified version.

For example, the line `github.com/golang/protobuf v1.5.2 h1:ROPKBNFfQgOUMifHyP+KYbvpjbdoFNs+aK7DXlji0Tw=` means that the `github.com/golang/protobuf` module at version `v1.5.2` has a hash of `ROPKBNFfQgOUMifHyP+KYbvpjbdoFNs+aK7DXlji0Tw=`.

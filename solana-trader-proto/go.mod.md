# go.mod

The `go.mod` file is used by Go's module system to manage project dependencies. It defines the module's path, which is used for import statements in the Go code, and its dependency requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the contents of this `go.mod` file:

* `module github.com/bloXroute-Labs/solana-trader-proto`: This line sets the module path, which other modules can use to import this one.
* `go 1.18`: This line specifies the Go version used by this module. The Go toolchain will use this to determine which language features are available when compiling the code.
* `require`: This keyword is followed by a list of dependencies, each with a specific version. For example, `github.com/golang/protobuf v1.5.2` means that this module requires version `v1.5.2` of the `github.com/golang/protobuf` module.
* `// indirect`: This comment indicates that the dependency is not directly imported by this module, but is required by another dependency. For example, `golang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20220127200216-cd36cc0744dd // indirect` means that the `golang.org/x/net` module is not directly imported by this module, but is required by one of its dependencies.

The `go.mod` file is automatically updated when you add an import to your code and then run a command like `go build`, `go test`, or `go mod tidy`. You can also manually add dependencies with the `go get` command.

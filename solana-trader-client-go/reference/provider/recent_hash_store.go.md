# recent\_hash\_store.go

The `recent_hash_store.go` file defines a structure and associated methods for storing and updating the most recent block hash in a Solana blockchain network. Here's a brief overview of what each function does:

* `newRecentBlockHashStore`: This function creates a new instance of `recentBlockHashStore`. It takes a block hash provider, a block hash stream provider, and RPC options as arguments.
* `run`: This method starts a goroutine that continuously updates the stored block hash by listening to a stream of new block hashes. If the stream cannot be opened, it logs an error and returns.
* `update`: This method updates the stored block hash and the time it was updated. It is called whenever a new block hash is received from the stream.
* `get`: This method returns the stored block hash if it is still valid (i.e., it has not expired). If the stored block hash is not valid or does not exist, it fetches a new block hash using the block hash provider, updates the stored block hash and its time, and returns the new block hash.
* `cached`: This method returns the stored block hash if it is still valid. If the stored block hash is not valid or does not exist, it returns nil.

The `recentBlockHashStore` struct uses a read-write mutex to ensure that updates and reads of the stored block hash are thread-safe. The block hash is considered valid until a certain duration (`hashExpiryDuration`) has passed since it was last updated.

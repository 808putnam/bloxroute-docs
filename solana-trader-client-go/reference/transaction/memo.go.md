# memo.go

The `memo.go` file defines several functions for adding a memo to a Solana transaction. Here's a breakdown:

1. `CreateTraderAPIMemoInstruction`: This function creates a new Solana instruction that places a memo in the transaction log. If no message is provided, it uses a default message. The memo instruction uses a specific program ID, `TraderAPIMemoProgram`.
2. `addMemo`: This function adds a memo instruction to a Solana transaction. It creates a memo instruction, adjusts the account indices of the existing instructions, and appends the memo instruction to the transaction.
3. `AddMemoAndSign`: This function adds a memo instruction to a serialized Solana transaction and signs it. It first decodes the transaction from base64 and gets the transaction. It then checks that the transaction does not already have too many account keys or a memo instruction. It adds a memo to the transaction, signs the transaction, and returns the signed transaction encoded in base64.

In summary, this file provides functions for adding a memo to a Solana transaction and signing it. The memo is used to indicate that the transaction is using the Trader API.

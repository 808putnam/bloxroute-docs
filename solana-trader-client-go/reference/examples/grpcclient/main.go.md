# main.go

This Go file is the main entry point for a program that interacts with the Solana blockchain via the bloXroute Labs' Solana Trader Client.

The `main` function initializes a logger and runs the `run` function, which performs a series of operations and logs any failures.

The `run` function does the following:

1. Loads a configuration file.
2. Creates a new GRPC client based on the environment specified in the configuration.
3. Calls a series of functions (like `callPoolsGRPC`, `callRaydiumPoolReserveGRPC`, `callMarketsGRPC`, etc.) using the GRPC client. These functions likely interact with the Solana blockchain to retrieve or send data. If any of these calls fail, it logs the failure.
4. Checks for environment variables `PUBLIC_KEY` and `PAYER`. If they exist, it performs additional operations like placing and cancelling orders.
5. Returns a boolean indicating whether any of the operations failed.
6. The `logCall` function is a helper function that logs the execution of a function and its result.
7. The `callMarketsGRPC` retrieves market data from the Solana blockchain and logs any errors.
8. `callBundleResultGRPC`: Fetches the result of a bundle operation using a given UUID.
9. `callOrderbookGRPC`: Fetches the order book for three different markets: "SOL-USDC", "SOLUSDT", and "SOL:USDC".
10. `callMarketDepthGRPC`: Fetches the market depth for the "SOL-USDC" market.
11. `callOpenOrdersGRPC`: Fetches open orders for the "SOLUSDC" market for a specific account.
12. `callUnsettledGRPC`: Fetches unsettled orders for the "SOLUSDC" market for a specific account.
13. `callGetAccountBalanceGRPC`: Fetches the balance of a specific account.
14. `callGetTokenAccountsGRPC`: Fetches token accounts for a specific owner address.
15. `callTickersGRPC`: Fetches ticker information for the "SOLUSDC" market.
16. `callPoolsGRPC`: Fetches information about pools for the Raydium project.
17. `callGetRateLimitGRPC`: Fetches the rate limit information.
18. `callGetTransactionGRPC`: Fetches a transaction by its signature.
19. `callRaydiumPoolReserveGRPC`: Fetches reserve information for specific Raydium pools.
20. `callRaydiumPoolsGRPC`: Fetches information about all Raydium pools.
21. `callPriceGRPC`: Fetches the price of specific tokens.
22. `callRaydiumPricesGRPC`: Fetches the prices of specific tokens on the Raydium platform.
23. `callJupiterPricesGRPC`: Fetches the prices of specific tokens on the Jupiter platform.
24. `callGetQuotes`: Fetches quotes for a specific token pair, with a specified amount, slippage, and limit.
25. `callGetRaydiumQuotes`: Fetches quotes for a specific token pair on the Raydium platform, with a specified amount and slippage.
26. `callGetJupiterQuotes`: Fetches quotes for a specific token pair on the Jupiter platform, with a specified amount and slippage.
27. `callOrderbookGRPCStream`: Establishes a streaming connection to get order book data for specific markets.
28. `callMarketDepthGRPCStream`: Establishes a streaming connection to get market depth data for specific markets. It first tries to establish a stream with an invalid market ("xxx") to demonstrate error handling, then establishes a stream with valid markets ("SOL/USDC", "SOL-USDT").
29. `callTradesGRPCStream`: Establishes a streaming connection to get trade data for a specific market ("SOL/USDC").
30. `callRecentBlockHashGRPCStream`: Establishes a streaming connection to get recent block hash data.
31. `callPoolReservesGRPCStream`: Establishes a streaming connection to get pool reserve data for specific pools in the Raydium project.
32. `orderLifecycleTest`: Demonstrates the lifecycle of an order by placing an order, waiting for it to be opened, cancelling it, and then settling it. It uses a streaming connection to get updates on the order status.
33. `callPlaceOrderGRPC`: Places an order on the blockchain. It first creates an unsigned order, then signs and submits it. Returns the clientOrderID for the order and a boolean indicating whether an error occurred.
34. `callPlaceOrderBundle`: Similar to `callPlaceOrderGRPC`, but it also includes a priority fee in the order. The order is signed and submitted in a single step.
35. `callPlaceOrderBundleWithBatch`: Similar to `callPlaceOrderBundle`, but it also includes a batch request. The order is signed and then included in a batch request, which is then submitted.
36. `callPlaceOrderGRPCWithPriorityFee`: Places an order with a priority fee. The order is signed and submitted in a single step.
37. `callCancelByClientOrderIDGRPC`: Cancels an order by its clientOrderID. It waits for 30 seconds before attempting to cancel the order to ensure that it has been opened.
38. `callPostSettleGRPC`: Settles an order. It submits a settle request for a specific order.
39. `cancelAll`: This function places two orders on the blockchain, checks if they are in the order book, cancels all orders, and then checks if the order book is empty. It returns a boolean indicating whether an error occurred (true if there was an error, false otherwise).
40. `callReplaceByClientOrderID`: This function places an order on the blockchain, checks if it is in the order book, replaces the order with a new one (with half the price), checks if the new order is in the order book, and then cancels all orders. It returns a boolean indicating whether an error occurred (true if there was an error, false otherwise).
41. `callReplaceOrder`: This function replaces an existing order on the blockchain with a new one. It first places an order, checks if it's in the order book, replaces it with a new order (with half the price), checks if the new order is in the order book, and then cancels all orders.
42. `callTradeSwap`: This function performs a trade swap transaction on the blockchain. It submits a trade swap request and logs the transaction signature.
43. `callRaydiumSwap`: This function performs a Raydium swap transaction on the blockchain. It submits a Raydium swap request and logs the transaction signature.
44. `callJupiterSwap`: This function performs a Jupiter swap transaction on the blockchain. It submits a Jupiter swap request and logs the transaction signature.
45. `callJupiterSwapInstructions`: This function performs a Jupiter swap transaction with instructions on the blockchain. It submits a Jupiter swap instructions request and logs the transaction signature.
46. `callRaydiumSwapInstructions`: This function performs a Raydium swap transaction with instructions on the blockchain. It submits a Raydium swap instructions request and logs the transaction signature.
47. `callRouteTradeSwap`: This function submits a route trade swap request to the blockchain and logs the transaction signature.
48. `callRaydiumRouteSwap`: This function submits a Raydium route swap request to the blockchain and logs the transaction signature.
49. `callJupiterRouteSwap`: This function submits a Jupiter route swap request to the blockchain and logs the transaction signature.
50. `callGetTickersGRPCStream`: This function requests a stream of ticker data from the blockchain and logs the received responses.
51. `callPricesGRPCStream`: This function requests a stream of price data from the blockchain and logs the received responses.
52. `callSwapsGRPCStream`: This function requests a stream of swap data from the blockchain and logs the received responses.
53. `callGetNewRaydiumPoolsStream`: This function requests a stream of new Raydium pool data from the blockchain and logs the received responses.
54. `callBlockGRPCStream`: This function requests a stream of block data from the blockchain and logs the received responses.
55. `callGetPriorityFeeGRPCStream`: This function requests a stream of priority fee data from the blockchain for the Raydium project and logs the received responses.
56. `callGetPriorityFeeGRPC`: This function makes a single request for priority fee data from the blockchain and logs the received response.
57. `callGetBundleTipGRPCStream`: This function requests a stream of bundle tip data from the blockchain and logs the received responses.

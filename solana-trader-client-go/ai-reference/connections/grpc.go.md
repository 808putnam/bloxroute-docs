# grpc.go

The `grpc.go` file defines a function `GRPCStream` that creates a Streamer for a gRPC client stream. Here's a breakdown:

1. `GRPCStream[T any](stream grpc.ClientStream, input string) Streamer[*T]`: This function takes a gRPC client stream and an input string as parameters. It returns a Streamer of type `*T`.
2. Inside the function, a new Streamer `generator` is defined. This Streamer function creates a new instance of type `T`, attempts to receive a message from the gRPC stream into this instance, and returns the instance and any error that occurred.
3. If the error is `io.EOF`, which signals the end of the input stream, it returns a custom error message indicating that the stream for the given input ended successfully.
4. If any other error occurs during the receive operation, it returns the error as is.
5. If no error occurs, it returns the received message.

In summary, this file provides a way to continuously receive messages from a gRPC client stream and return them as a Streamer. This can be useful for processing streaming data from a gRPC service.

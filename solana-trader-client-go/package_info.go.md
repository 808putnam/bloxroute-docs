# package\_info.go

The `package_info.go` file defines package-level variables for the `package_info` package in Go.

These variables can be accessed from other packages to get information about the `package_info` package. For example, they might be used to print the application's name and version number when it starts up.

Here's a brief overview of what each line does:

1. `package package_info`: This line declares the package name, which is `package_info`.
2. `var Version = "v1.9.3"`: This line declares a string variable named `Version` and assigns it the value `"v1.9.3"`. This is likely the version number of the package or application.
3. `var Name = "solana-trader-client-go"`: This line declares a string variable named `Name` and assigns it the value `"solana-trader-client-go"`. This is likely the name of the package or application.

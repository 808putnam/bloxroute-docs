# signing\_test.go

The `signing_test.go` file defines a test function `TestSignTxWithPrivateKey` that tests the `SignTxWithPrivateKey` function. Here's a breakdown:

1. `TestSignTxWithPrivateKey`: This function tests the `SignTxWithPrivateKey` function. It does this by creating a new Solana transaction, signing it with a private key, and validating the result.
2. Inside the function, it first converts the test private key from a base58 string to a `solana.PrivateKey`.
3. It then calls `SignTxWithPrivateKey` with the partially signed transaction and the private key. This function is expected to sign the transaction with the private key.
4. It then validates the result. It checks that the signed transaction is equal to the expected signed transaction.

In summary, this file provides a test for the `SignTxWithPrivateKey` function, which signs a Solana transaction with a private key.

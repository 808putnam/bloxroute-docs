# memo\_test.go

The `memo_test.go` file defines a test function `TestAddMemoToSerializedTxn` that tests the `AddMemoAndSign` function. Here's a breakdown:

1. `TestAddMemoToSerializedTxn`: This function tests the `AddMemoAndSign` function. It does this by creating a new Solana transaction, serializing it to base64, adding a memo and signing it, and then validating the result.
2. Inside the function, it first creates a new private key and a map of public keys to private keys. It then creates a new transaction builder and adds a generic instruction to it.
3. It sets the recent block hash and the fee payer for the transaction, builds the transaction, and serializes it to base64.
4. It then calls `AddMemoAndSign` with the serialized transaction and the private key. This function is expected to add a memo to the transaction and sign it.
5. It then validates the result. It deserializes the signed transaction from base64, gets the transaction, and checks that it has two instructions. It also checks that the program of the second instruction is the `TraderAPIMemoProgram`.

In summary, this file provides a test for the `AddMemoAndSign` function, which adds a memo to a Solana transaction and signs it.

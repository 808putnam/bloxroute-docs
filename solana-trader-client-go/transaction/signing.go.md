# signing.go

The `signing.go` file in the `transaction` package defines several functions for signing Solana transactions. Here's a breakdown:

1. `LoadPrivateKeyFromEnv`: This function retrieves the private key from the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable and converts it from a base58 string to a `solana.PrivateKey`.
2. `SignTx`: This function signs a Solana transaction with the private key from the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. It first loads the private key from the environment variable and then signs the transaction with it.
3. `SignTxWithPrivateKey`: This function signs a Solana transaction with a provided private key. It first decodes the transaction from base64, gets the transaction, signs the transaction with the private key, and returns the signed transaction encoded in base64.
4. `signTx`: This function signs a Solana transaction with a provided private key. It first checks that the number of signatures in the transaction is equal to the number of required signatures. If there is one missing signature, it appends a signature. If there are no missing signatures, it replaces a zero signature. If there are more than one missing signatures, it returns an error.
5. `appendSignature`: This function appends a signature to a Solana transaction. It first encodes the message for signing, signs the message with the private key, and appends the signature to the transaction.
6. `replaceZeroSignature`: This function replaces a zero signature in a Solana transaction with a signature. It first encodes the message for signing, signs the message with the private key, finds a zero signature in the transaction, and replaces it with the signature.
7. `PartialSign`: This function signs a Solana transaction with all available private keys, except the main Solana address's. It first checks that the number of private keys is equal to the number of required signatures minus one. It then encodes the message for signing, signs the message with each private key, and sets the signatures of the transaction.

In summary, this file provides functions for signing Solana transactions with a private key, either provided directly or retrieved from an environment variable.

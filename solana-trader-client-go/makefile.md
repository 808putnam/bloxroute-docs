# Makefile

The `Makefile` is used by the `make` command to automate tasks for building and managing the project.&#x20;

The `.PHONY` before each target is a special target that tells `make` that the target is not a file. This is used when the target name does not represent a file but is just a name for a recipe to be executed.

Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

1. `test` and `unit`: These targets run the Go tests in verbose mode for all packages in the project.
2. `grpc-examples`, `http-examples`, and `ws-examples`: These targets run the respective example Go programs.
3. `ssl-testnet` and `ssl-mainnet`: These targets create directories for storing SSL certificates and keys, and then copy these files from an AWS S3 bucket to the created directories.
4. `cred-github`: This target copies a `.netrc` file (which typically contains login credentials for remote servers) from an AWS S3 bucket to the current directory.
5. `environment-dev`: This target depends on `ssl-testnet` and `cred-github`, so running `make environment-dev` will run these two targets.
